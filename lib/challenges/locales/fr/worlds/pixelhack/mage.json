We're going to make a Mage character for an RPG game so first we need to set the scene, we'll use the darken function to change the color teal to a more suitable shade of dark blue - **tape** `background darken teal,15 `\n2. We're making pixel art so we'll turn the stroke off - **tape** `stroke 0`\n3. Let's set the color to saddlebrown for her hair - **tape** `color saddlebrown`\n4. We'll use the moveTo function to move the cursor to a specific espace de travail coordinate - **tape** `moveTo 120,80`\n5. We're going to draw the hair first so we can layer the rest of the character over it to create depth - **tape** `rectangle 320,400`\n6. We're going to be drawing with blocks 20 by 20 pixels big - **tape** `move 20,-20`\n7. Stack up another layer of hair - **tape** `rectangle 280,20`\n8. Déplace-toi upwards again to create a rounded effect - **tape** `move 20,-20`\n9. Dessine the final row of hair in - **tape** `rectangle 240,20`\n10. Next we'll draw the face, - **tape** `color sandybrown`\n11. Déplace-toi the cursor to the top corner of where the face will be - **tape** `move 0,120`\n12. Dessine the face with a `rectangle` that is 240 by 140\n13. The face is a little too square so move the cursor up to the forehead - **tape** `move 80,-40`\n14. Dessine another rectangle to create a fringe - **tape** `rectangle 80,40`\n15. Déplace-toi the cursor down the face - **tape** `move -40,180`\n16. Finish the face off by drawing a chin - **tape** `rectangle 160,20`\n17. Next we'll draw some robes, our mage specialises in water magic so we'll make them blue - **tape** `color paleturquoise`\n18. Position the cursor for drawing the sleeves  - **tape** `move -100,20`\n19. Dessine a `rectangle` 360 wide and 80 tall for the robe sleeves\n20. Position the cursor to draw the body of the robe - **tape** `move 60,80`\n21. Dessine a `rectangle` 240 wide and 100 tall for the robe body\n22. Next we'll draw a seam on the robe, change the `color` to teal\n23. Déplace-toi the cursor to the middle of the robe - **tape** `move 120,-80`\n24. Dessine a thin rectangle for the seam - **tape** `rectangle 40,180`\n25. Next up we'll draw the arms - **tape** `move 140,40`\n26. Change the `color` back to sandybrown\n27. Dessine the arm with a `rectangle` 40 by 140\n28. Déplace-toi to the the other side of the body - **tape** `move -380,40`\n29. This arm will be disconnected at first but don't worry, we haven't finished yet - **tape** `rectangle 40,100`\n30. Every mage needs a staff to cast magic, so we'll draw that next - **tape** `color darkmagenta`\n31. Déplace-toi to the top of the staff - **tape** `move 60,-120`\n32. Dessine the staff over the arm so it looks like it's being held - **tape** `rectangle -40,220`\n33. As we said at the start our character uses water magic so set the color to aquamarine - **tape** `color aquamarine`\n34. Dessine an orb at the top of the staff, if we use negative numbers then shapes are drawn backwards - **tape** `square -80`\n35. We're also going to draw a magic circlet, move to the forehead - **tape** `move 60,-200`\n36. Dessine a `rectangle` that is 240 by 20\n37. Shift down a row on our grid - **tape** `move -20,20`\n38. Finish off the circlet - **tape** `rectangle 280,20`\n39. We just need to finish off the face so position the cursor over the eyes - **tape** `move 60,60`\n40. Définis the `color` à noir (black)\n41. Dessine the eyes long and thin - **tape** `rectangle 40,80`\n42. Déplace-toi across for the other eye - **tape** `move 120,0`\n43. Dessine the other eye - **tape** `rectangle 40,80`\n44. One last detail, we're going to make the eyes shiny - **tape** `color white`\n45. Dessine a smaller rectangle within the pupil - **tape** `rectangle 20,40`\n46. Déplace-toi to the other eye - **tape** `move -120,0`\n47. Finish off with one last rectangle - **tape** `rectangle 20,40`\n\n#### What you’ll hack\nThis is a much more intricate drawing, so there are many more things to change. You can go through the colours making up the image and change them to a new palette, and add in new objects. Take a look at the warrior and the lightning mage as ways of powering up your warrior with new powers, armour and weapons.\n\n#### Briefing\nThe simple shapes you have been putting together into simple designs can be refined and brought into more complex creations. This RPG Mage is a much more intricate design, but uses just the same tools to create them.\n"
