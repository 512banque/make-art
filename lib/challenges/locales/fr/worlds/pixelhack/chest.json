Role Playing Games (RPGs) became one of the most popular genres of games in the late 80s. One of the most common objects in these games is the loot chest, let's start by setting a moody scene with a background **tape** `background darkslategray`\n2.

We're going to layer this up to keep the number of shapes we have to draw to a minimum, first we draw the golden frame draw a `rectangle` 300 by 200\n6.

Déplace-toi your cursor to get ready to draw the wooden part of the chest **tape** `move 25,0`\n9. Change the fill color to `color brown`\n10.

Déplace-toi in to draw the actual clasp **tape** `move 25,25`\n20. Définis the `color` to darkbrown\n21. Finally draw a `rectangle` 50 by 75\n\n#### What you'll hack\nBy changing the colours and adding a few shapes you can build an environment around your chest. For a more complex challenge change your code to open the chest and code some loot within.\n\n#### Briefing \nThe loot chest has made appearances in too many video games to list. Possibly most prominently in games from the Legend of Zelda, where they would hold everything from small gifts of money to powerful new tools and weapons. What is in this loot chest? That’s up to you. When you’re done with the chest, open it up and put in your own creation as the loot.\n"
