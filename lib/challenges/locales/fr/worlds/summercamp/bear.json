    "description": "Bears are very smart and have been known to roll rocks into bear traps to set off the trap and then eat the bait in safety. These animals can run up to 40 miles per hour, fast enough to catch a running horse. Take into account that the fastest known human alive today is Usain Bolt, who can run at 27mph! And because bears can walk short distances on their hind legs, some Native Americans called them “the beast that walks like a man.”",
