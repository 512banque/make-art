    "description": "Torches started life as ignited sticks; their flames would light the way for explorers and settlers. With the advent of electricity, and the invention of the dry cell battery in 1887, the road was paved to use incandescent bulbs as a replacement. While the technology inside flashlights has evolved, they are still as useful as ever. Meanwhile, the original torch has found a second coming in circus acts where they are thrown skywards in miraculous fashion.",
