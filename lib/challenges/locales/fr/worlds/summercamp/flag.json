We’ve got you started with the basics for a flag and flagpole, but it is up to you to to make it your own.  \nYou can look to other flags for inspiration. Countries like France, Nigeria, Sweden, and Switzerland all have very simple color and shape designs, while Spain, Brazil, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia all feature complex designs. When you are done, share your flag to lay claim to your little bit of land!",
