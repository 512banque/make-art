    "description": "Dick Kelty is the inventor of the aluminium frame backpack. Kelty got the idea for his backpack in 1951 when he and a friend were hiking in the Sierra Nevada. Working in his garage, and with $500 borrowed against his house, Kelty and his wife went into production; he cut and welded the aluminium frames, while she stitched the nylon. They sold the finished backpacks for $24 apiece.",
