    "description": "First Aid is the most popular merit badge. In fact, 6.9 million Scouts have earned it since its debut in 1911. Other popular ones are Environmental Science, Search and Rescue, and our favourites Programming and Game Design! There are some oddballs as well. For example Truck transportation: “Assume that you are going to ship by truck 500 pounds of goods (freight class 65) from your town to another town 500 miles away. Your shipment must arrive within three days. Explain in writing…”. And Nuclear Science “Obtain a sample of irradiated and non-irradiated foods. Prepare the two foods and compare their taste and texture.”",
